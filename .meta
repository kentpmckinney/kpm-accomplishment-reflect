Summary: `A dispatch review process tool that quadrupled productivity`
Description: `
Company: Stream Global Services
Year: 2008

Purpose: a process flow tool named ‘Reflect’ was used by 40+ team leads and senior technicians. It included several time-saving features favored when dispatching parts and service as well as aspects desired by management to collect data not available through other means and to reduce preventable repeat dispatches. It included several types of automation, such as the validation of street addresses, auto-detection of common errors, looking up data in various internal, web-based line-of-business applications, and data-entry into CRM tools.

My Role: I was the technical lead for the project which had five team members over a period of a year and a half. I wrote about 50% of the code.

Outcome: This project reduced the time needed to review and process dispatches by a factor of 4, thus requiring 1/4 of the FTEs to do the same amount of work. Reflect had been in use for four years as of the time I left the company.

Technical Details: Reflect is an HTA (HTML Application), an older technology intended to make web pages look and feel like Windows applications. Reflect included 85 different .js files in its final version, many of which were common both to Reflect and Echo. Due to budget constraints, this tool was designed to run from a shared drive without needing a server, and so the functionality of the application was almost entirely JavaScript/JScript.
